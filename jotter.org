* Here are some words 
** Turn loop in Coffeescript
   - if not current player's turn
     - query for next move, and apply it once it arrives

   - if current player's turn

     - Buttons
       - "Confirm" sends the current state, but doesn't become active
         unless the current tile has been placed.
         - Clicking it disables all three buttons.

       - "Remove Tile" deletes the updated state.
         - Clicking it disables all three buttons.

       - "Remove Meeple" removes the meeple from the updated state.
         - Clicking it disables itself.

     - Placement
       - Tile
         - Activates "Confirm" and "Remove Tile"
         - Disables all other tile placement options.

       - Meeple
         - Activates "Remove Meeple"
         - If Meeple is already placed
           - If new position is invalid, raise an error and don't move
             the Meeple
           - Else, move the Meeple

     - Record initial state at beginning of player's turn
       - This is the state the "Remove Tile" button reverts to.
     - Player places Tile
       - This creates the state that the "Remove Meeple" button reverts to.
       - Whenever a valid Meeple placement is generated, it is based on
         this state.
     - player can now opt to put a meeple on the tile
       - placing the meeple updates the state again
       - if the player clicks on a feature that's already controlled,
         an error is raised
       - if the feature is free, a meeple is placed
       - any subsequent click will either move the meeple, or raise an
         error and leave the meeple where it is
       - "Remove Meeple" reverts the meeple state
       - confirm sends the current state
     - scoring takes place on newly finished features

** Turn object
   tile_id:         int
   x:               int
   y:               int
   rotation:        int
   meeple_feature:  string
** Board vs. Game
   Game has static information:
   - tile definitions
   - edge definitions
   - which player is this?
   - what is the current board
   - what is the prospective board
     
   Board seems like the wrong nomenclature though. State is more
   appropriate. A game has states, states can have associated turns,
   states can be reverted. A state has a board, filled with tiles...

   State has fluid information:
   - which tiles have been placed, and where (Board)
   - what are the states of the features (Cloister, Road, Cities, etc.)
   - where are all the meeples
